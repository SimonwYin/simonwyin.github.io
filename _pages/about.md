# 🧐 About Me
I am now a master student at [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/), [School of Cyber Science and Technology](https://cst.buaa.edu.cn/), supervised by [Dr. Yanqing Yao](https://cst.buaa.edu.cn/info/1112/2746.htm). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree at [Xidian University (XDU)](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), [School of Cyber Engineering](https://cst.buaa.edu.cn/), under supervision of [Dr. Shanfeng Wang](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/sfwang/index.html) and [Dr. Yanqing Yao](https://cst.buaa.edu.cn/info/1112/2746.htm) in June 2023.

My research interest includes **Privacy-preserving Federated Learning** and **Privacy-enhancing Techniques** (including but not limited to Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Multi-party Computation (SMPC)), I work to design and develop practical privacy-preserving tools for federated learning and any other big data technologies. **Currently, I am deeply involved in projects related to Federated Learning and Differential Privacy as part of my Master's research.**

From 2023 to 2024, I worked at [DouBao](https://www.doubao.com/chat/)![DouBao](../images/tiktok.png) as a daily intern in Beijing, undertaking data analytics cohort tasks under the guidance of Mr. Zhaojian Li.

From 2023 to 2024, I worked at [ByteDance - DouBao](https://www.doubao.com/chat/) as a daily intern in Beijing, undertaking data analytics cohort tasks under the guidance of Mr. Zhaojian Li.

In my first two years before joining ByteDance, I conducted research work on the Graduate Thesis at [Workstation of Mao Ming, Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E6%97%A0%E4%BA%BA%E8%A3%85%E5%A4%87%E4%BA%A7%E4%B8%9A%E5%88%9B%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83/61692750), under the supervision of [Dr. Jingjing Fan](https://lwss.ncut.edu.cn/TutorServlet?action=queryDs&teacherid=qq2scN_gHl_@_byvOok@JA==).

My research interest includes Machine Learning, Inverse Reinforcement Learning, and Autonomous Driving Decision Making. **Currently, I am deeply involved in specific projects related to Federated Learning and Optimization perspectives for my PhD research.**

# ✨ Miscellaneous
Apart from academic pursuits, I enjoy a wide range of sports such as swimming, cycling, badminton and ping-pong. Additionally, I am a passionate photographer, always seeking to capture the beauty of the world through my lens. One of my special hobbies is that I love all things about deduction and suspense, especially I am a fan of the anime 名探偵コナン (Detective Conan, 名侦探柯南) and the TV series Detective Dee (神探狄仁杰)!
